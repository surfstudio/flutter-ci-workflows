# GitHub Actions

Repository for storing reusable workflows and workflows for repositories. Also we store here all issue and PR templates.

> [!CAUTION]
> Used **only** on **SurfGear** packages.

## Folders

- `.github/workflow` – reusable workflows
- `.github/repository_workflows_and_templates` – workflows and templates for repositories, when starting a project you just need to copy the contents to your `.github` folder
- `.github/workflows_archive` – reusable workflows that have been used in the past and may be useful in the future

Descriptions of how workflows work can be found in Confluence.
